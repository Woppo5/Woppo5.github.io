  <!-- TEXT Section -->
  
  <p>The upp famery is a famery in califoria.</p>
  
  <p>However no matter how weird it may seem the most <b />special one is the one with the pinecone (in her own little way)</p>
  
<p> The least intresting one is the boy on the far left<b />
    (the one who is standing) is the least intresting of all</p> 
<p>But the most intresting is blue and is nor human or animal<b />
   tis a rainbow blue bear! he is like no other this existing<b />
   or dead</p>
